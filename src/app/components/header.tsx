          I am a Full-stack Software Engineer with more than {elapsedYears} years of experience. I am motivated by building products that help people help people - by providing a service to a community that helps them give back to society. I have worked on small to medium sized teams across various industries like healthcare and election forecasting. Iâ€™ve built Generative AI products and tools for professional, academic and personal projects.
          I enjoy working on teams that foster a culture of open and honest communication, provide opportunities to wear many hats, and encourage collaboration and mentorship.
